# lehigh-email-web-scraper
Get student's emails by their names using Lehigh People Directory (LDAP) Search

### Instructions 
1. Download Python and Lehigh's Cisco AnyConnect VPN if you don't have it

2. See required packages to install in requirements.txt (in cmd use: pip install INSERT_PACKAGE_NAME_HERE)

    - pip install bs4
    - pip install requests

    - I used python 3 and it worked having installed the packages.

3. Copy and Paste all the names from the most recent Dean's List into DCPNM.csv

    - The Deans_list_web_scaper.py is not functioning as the webpage is no longer the list and instead it just lists the pdf lists.
    - Personally I used a list like [[DCPNM.csv]] and the [[emails_from_spreadsheet.py]]. (DCPNM is Delta Chi Potential new members).

4. Add "Directory" as the first line

5. Delete "Deanâ€™s List (Semester)" line

6. Run [[emails_from_spreadsheet.py]]

    - RUN THIS WHILE IN VPN AS IT REQUIRES LOGIN OTHERWISE (or just be on the campus wifi).
    - This will take a while to run as it sleeps as to not get spam blocked by the email query.
